        <h1>Balance</h1>
        <p>Intuitively, we think about balance as "50-50". Hence, for example,  I always thought that trying to have a balanced life is a complete waste of time because you end up splitting your energy on 'n' different things that might matter rather than on the 1 or 2 things that matter the most. But I have come to realize that that kind of thinking is flawed. Why? Let's take an example - When we eat a dish that is particularly delicious, we often compliment it by saying "That was well balanced" or "it had a great balance of flavour". But did the dish have equal parts of everything? Did it have equal parts salt, sugar, spices and broth? Of course not.
            <br><br>
            And that is why the concept of a "balanced life" can co-exist with focusing on the things that matter the most. You can and should focus on the one or two things that matter the most while reserving some time and energy that matters less by themselves, but when combined with the former result in an exponentially better life. Let's take a specific example - If you're working as a surgeon in a hospital- your primary focus will and should be your craft. But consciously allocating a portion of your time/energy for exercise or sport can indirectly aid in flourishing at your main craft by adding a different dimension to your life similar to how a pinch of salt can be the difference between a good cookie and a bad one or some sugar can be the difference between good pho and a mediocre one. 
            <br><br>
            Until now, I have been reasoning through comparison and food metaphors, which, to some, might seem like a bit of a stretch. Why, specifically, should one consciously spend time/energy on something that is not the "main thing" in their life? Because the way we perceive time, the type of energy we spend and what results from spending that energy are three variables that differ based on the activity we are engaged in. Hence, adding a different "dimension" or activity to your life results in a completely different perception of time, effort and outcomes which serves as a productive distraction. But how can a distraction be productive?
            <br><br>
            A "distraction" can be productive only when its resulting perception of time, effort and outcomes are complimentary to the main thing. For example, being a surgeon involves a lot of technical focus which might result in time being perceived as passing slowly, the effort being perceived as high owing to the requirement of surgical focus (literally!) and the outcome being perceived as uncertain. If this surgeon were to engage in an activity such as Tennis  - they would be perceiving time, effort and outcomes in a completely different yet complimentary way to their main craft. They don't need to play every day. Even if they play once a week - their life is still "balanced" in the sense that they are getting just the right amount of time engaging in something different from surgery.
            <br><br>
            So it is valuable to think about what gets you going outside of your main craft and treat it as a complimentary asset to help keep you focused on your main craft. That is how I have come to think about "balance".
