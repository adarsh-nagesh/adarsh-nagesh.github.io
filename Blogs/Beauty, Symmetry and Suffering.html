        <h1>Beauty, Symmetry and Suffering</h1>
        <p>
            When we hear the word beauty we usually think about aesthetic and visual beauty. But that is just one manifestation of beauty which happens to be the most literal one. There is more to beauty - it is way more abstract and profound. Although it is hard to capture the concept of beauty with mere words, I will attempt to speak about why understanding the nature of beauty is foundational to finding meaning. 
            <br><br>    
            At its core, beauty represents symmetry. But not just visual symmetry - it represents symmetry across space-time, symmetry across conceptual and real, symmetry across intention and action, symmetry across inner and outer. And this symmetry is not always obvious. But once realized, it feels deeply meaningful - meaningful in a way which does not have a reason for being meaningful. We feel this beauty when we look at breathtaking architecture, paintings, people and things.
            <br><br>
            But as I described before, beauty is more abstract and deeper than what is visible. There is beauty in sailors setting out to sail and reaching their destination. There is beauty in an athlete setting out to win against all odds and winning. There is beauty in a writer expressing his deepest thoughts through prose. What is the one thing that is common among these examples? There is a subtle symmetry between intent and action, between the inner and the outer, and between reality and perception. So any activity that produces symmetry, in a literal sense or in an abstract one, is beautiful. 
            <br><br>
            We are used to things that are literally beautiful but building an intuition for beautiful things that are less literal and more abstract can help bring deep meaning to suffering. Let us first talk about self-imposed suffering, usually in the pursuit of a specific end state. This pursuit can be as simple as washing dishes to have a clean plate to eat on or it could be a more complex undertaking such as building a habitable space station. These pursuits involve suffering of varying degrees. Washing dishes requires you to get up, go to the kitchen and wash the dishes while building a habitable space station involves formulating a multi-decade plan, executing, experimenting etc. But there is suffering nonetheless. 
            <br><br>
            However, the point of engaging in either activity is to achieve symmetry and every micro-step along the way contributes to that symmetry. So symmetry is not just an end state we are chasing but every component of that end state involves more symmetry. That means there is beauty hidden within every micro-step of a grand end state. While engaging in these micro-steps we experience suffering. So one conclusion we might arrive at is - Suffering signifies impending beauty. But that conclusion is a weak one. 
            <br><br>
            The right conclusion is - Suffering IS beauty. This is because suffering directly forms a symmetric relationship with the end state we are pursuing, within a micro-step or otherwise. Hence this symmetry, although highly abstract, represents beauty. 
            <br><br>
            Let us now tackle suffering that is imposed upon us by other people or circumstances. The symmetry of the end-state does not apply here, rather, the key to finding beauty is to seek symmetry between reality and perception. That can mean constructing a new reality to match a rich perception or constructing a new perception to match reality or a combination of both. Rather than explaining what that looks and feels like, I will cite a paragraph from Victor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning:
            <br><br>
            <i>“The story of the young woman whose death I witnessed in a concentration camp. It is a simple story. There is little to tell and it may sound as if I had invented it; but to me it seems like a poem. This young woman knew that she would die in the next few days. But when I talked to her she was cheerful in spite of this knowledge. "I am grateful that fate has hit me so hard," she told me. "In my former life I was spoiled and did not take spiritual accomplishments seriously." Pointing through the window of the hut, she said, "This tree here is the only friend I have in my loneliness." Through that window she could see just one branch of a chestnut tree, and on the branch were two blossoms. "I often talk to this tree," she said to me. I was startled and didn't quite know how to take her words. Was she delirious? Did she have occasional hallucinations? Anxiously I asked her if the tree replied. "Yes." What did it say to her? She answered, "It said to me, 'I am here-I am here-I am life, eternal life.” </i>
            <br><br>
            This young woman pursued a very abstract sense of beauty in the midst of suffering by moulding perception and reality to achieve symmetry. 
            <br><br>
            There is beauty hidden in every nook and cranny of life. Be willing to see it. It makes life deeply meaningful. Thought about another way - The pursuit of meaning IS the pursuit of beauty. The pursuit of beauty IS the pursuit of symmetry. The pursuit of symmetry IS the pursuit of suffering. 
            <br><br>
            Life is filled with suffering, yet beautiful.
