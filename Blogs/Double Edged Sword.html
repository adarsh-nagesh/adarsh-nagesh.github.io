        <h1>Double Edged Sword</h1>
        <p>I have been thinking about double-edged swords and how they might be a good metaphor for thinking about strengths and weaknesses.
            <br><br>
            I think the framing of “strength” and “weakness” being completely separate things is a bad one. I have found that what I consider a weakness is my strength in some situations and vice versa. So the problem with the traditional framing is twofold:
            <br><br>
            - Your weakness becomes a source of insecurity that needs to be “worked on”. And by working on it you run the risk of making a potential sword (i.e. strength) blunt.
            <br>
            - On the other hand, your strength becomes a source of security which causes you to have blindspots and ignore how your own sword can hurt you.
            <br><br>
            So the act of categorizing something as a “strength” or a “weakness” has some unanticipated effects. You might become well-rounded but do you want to be a well-rounded stick or do you want to be a sharp sword? 
            <br><br>
            I asked that question in a pretty loaded way but the answer is actually not obvious. Because being a sharp sword has its risks. You hurt yourself often and risk being ostracized because you’re different.
            <br><br>
            But if you know you want to be a sword, you ideally want to take advice from people who are like you or you run the risk of getting advice that goes against your natural grain. Or at the very least you want to get advice from people who have advised folks like you before. This is because most people tend to derive advice from their own journey and philosophy. It is very hard to decouple the two. And if you take that advice too seriously you just make your way towards the mean. 
            <br><br>
            So be selective with whom you take advice from. This means you need to be really self-aware in order not to go off the rails or have blindspots, given you will probably operate at the edge most of the time. And operating on the edge is not an excuse to not think things through. Thinking things through is table stakes. 
            <br><br>
            And when you focus on wielding your metaphorical sword you might come across as weird/different to other people and that is okay. But - the goal is to not be different/weird. I have seen so many people mistake the two. Being different as a result of focusing on your own sword vs being different for the sake of being different are two very different things. The latter might seem useful but it doesn’t move the needle in any way.
            <br><br>
            This framing is also pretty relevant when giving advice. Try not to project your own experience without trying to understand what/who the other person is. And if they are very different from you, don’t guess and give advice anyway. It would be much more helpful if you introduced them to someone with similar inclinations.  </p>
