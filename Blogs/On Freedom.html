        <h1>On Freedom</h1>
        <p>"Wealth unlocks freedom."
            <br><br>
            That is something that a lot of us “know”. 
            <br><br>
            But unless you are wealthy and have unlocked freedom through that wealth, chances are your knowledge is purely intellectual. You don't truly understand it.
            <br><br>
            I am the same. I have been thinking about freedom a lot recently and in a moment of clarity, I realized how futile all of my thinking and striving towards understanding freedom has been.
            <br><br>
            No matter how much "effort" you put into deeply understanding concepts that live in the intellectual domain, you will not get any closer to understanding them. That is because things cannot be understood for the sake of understanding. The act of understanding in itself is a layer of abstraction that is separated from the actual thing you're trying to understand. And any amount of analytical insight gained from this abstraction doesn't really get you closer, although it might seem like it. 
            <br><br>
            True understanding emerges naturally as a byproduct of genuine desire. In this case, the desire for wealth is secondary - the desire for freedom is the primary desire. And a sincere desire for freedom is what unlocks true understanding. That desire only emerges when you completely use the existing freedom you already have in your current circumstances and hit a ceiling. 
            <br><br>
            Most of us seem to only use 30-40% of our freedom and express our desire to build wealth to unlock freedom. That desire is not genuine. How can it be? You have not even tasted true freedom. 
            <br><br>
            From my experience so far “freedom” is not all sugary. It involves saying "No" a lot. It involves letting people down. It involves risking a significant reduction in social exposure. It involves being disliked. It involves not fitting in. Feeling the pain of doing all of this by choice is what unlocks the desire for the freedom that wealth unlocks. 
            <br><br>
            You must start by questioning the "shoulds" and "have to's". Hidden there are leeches that suck your true self out of you leaving behind a nice-looking shell.
