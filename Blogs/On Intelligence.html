        <h1>Overthink but don't overreact</h1>
        <p>When we hear the word “intelligence”, we are naturally drawn to think about IQ or the general notion of someone being smart. But what does it really mean to be “intelligent”?
            <br><br>
            One might come up with some indicators to determine if one is intelligent:
            <ul>
            <li>IQ score</li>
            <li>Rate of information processing</li>
            <li>Rate of learning and unlearning</li>
            <li>Command over math and language</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            
            And many many more. While these are plausible indicators to determine the degree to which one is intelligent, it fails to encapsulate some of the subtler aspects of intelligence that make it sought after and useful.
            <br><br>
            At a high level, these subtler aspects are encapsulated by a natural ability to rapidly contextualize the External seamlessly with the Internal. I prefer not to use the term “Self Awareness” as it seems to convey a slightly different meaning which is more focused on the Internal.
            <br><br>
            Intelligence, at its core, does involve rapidly processing external information to produce meaningful outputs. However, we often overlook how external processing fits in with our internal awareness. And this is important because, despite the existence of an objective reality, a lot of our behaviours and decisions are driven by perceptions, not reality.
            <br><br>
            These perceptions are what makes me, me and what makes you, you. But these same perceptions act as a hindrance to rational thought. True intelligence lies at the heart of effectively managing this very conflict. Managing this conflict doesn’t involve being 100% rational or being completely driven by our perceptions. But it is the art of recognizing the precise nature of our perceptions, understanding what the world looks like without these perceptions and reconciling them with what place these perceptions hold within the context of our true self.
            <br><br>
            Different perceptions have different sources, utility and meanings. A lot of our perceptions are a result of our conditioning and environment. But some perceptions are truly ours i.e our unique way of looking at the world. But perceptions also differ when it comes to the degree of practical utility it provides, in a way which is independent of their source. For example - A certain way of looking at the world that isn’t natural to you might end up providing greater practical utility in solving your life problems than your own way of looking at the world. (Utility can also mean feeling good about oneself)
            <br><br>
            The “meaning” that we derive from perceptions is a function of their source and utility. And intelligence allows us to decode this meaning and regulate our perceptions accordingly to produce a meaningful output. Here is a pictorial representation of the same:

            The intelligence I am referring to in this article to is the interplay of the black box (which can be approximated to self-awareness in some instances) and our brain a.k.a raw intelligence. In some instances, it might even be plausible to call this intelligence “wisdom”.
            <br><br>
            This intelligence is the hardest to cultivate. With some effort, we might be able to get better at the individual components but their interplay is an entirely different game.
            <br><br>
            As far as I know, there is no real prescription to develop this kind of intelligence. But it seems to be a true differentiator in living a meaningful and fulfilling life.
