        <h1>Overthink but don't overreact</h1>
        <p>
            When my mind is full of thoughts I write a lot. It feels like taking a sea of thoughts out of my head and bringing it to life in the form of words so I can observe it carefully to achieve some clarity. 
            <br><br>
            And I have one observation worth sharing (that I suspect other people can relate with) - A lot of my stressful thoughts tend to be overreactions to highly temporary dips in momentum →  these thoughts tend to push you to draw conclusions about what needs to be done moving forward → As a result, you overcorrect often that disrupts momentum further. 
            <br><br>
            "Don't overthink" is pretty trite and ineffective advice to resolve this kind of doom loop. "Overthink, but don't overreact" is probably better advice. Because if you are the overthinking type, you are gifted with a high sensitivity to reality. If you "stop overthinking", you might resolve the stress issue but you also give up on your ability to be sensitive to reality and pick up clues that others can't (And I highly doubt that people can just stop "overthinking").

            How does one "not overreact"? By being highly attuned to the difference between thoughts, actions and reactions. The formation of thoughts is out of one's control. They are nothing more than data points. Actions are consciously constructed functions that are dependent on thought variables. Reactions are sub-consciously half-constructed functions that are dependent on thought variables. Since we have established thoughts are out of one's control - what is under one's control are well-constructed transformation functions that transform these thoughts into meaningful interactions with reality. When these functions are not well constructed - one begins to "overreact". 
            <br><br>
            So what I have realized is that trying to achieve clarity of mind is less about worrying about thoughts (in fact the thoughts themselves are very rich data points). It is more about figuring out how to use those data points to flourish. 
            <br><br>
            Don't manage thoughts. Manage attention.
