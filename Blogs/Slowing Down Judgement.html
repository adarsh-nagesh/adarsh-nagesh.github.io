        <h1>Slowing Down Judgement</h1>
        <p>At some point in our lives, we have been taught not to judge. At a later stage, we probably realized that judgement is actually very important - one must at least be able to judge right from wrong.
            <br><br>
            We know the former is true in some way but we reap immediate benefits from the latter. Having good judgement makes all the difference, in business and in life. But there is more to it than meets the eye.
            <br><br>
            We are used to honing our judgement in everything we do - Sports, Cooking, People Management, Business and etc. And that is good because deliberate practice makes all the difference when it comes to being successful at such things. However, we carry over a similar mindset into everyday life, or worse when we are naturally being creative, and that is when it starts to work against us.
            <br><br>
            While most things require us to process information at a rapid rate and judge, some things require us to slow down. Don’t get me wrong - There is high value in rapid iteration provided the end result is a net positive and you’re willing to change your mind/learn from mistakes. However, we often fail to recognize the value of sitting still and slowing down. It’s a passive process but it reveals insights that you might have otherwise missed.
            <br><br>
            This is especially overlooked in the Silicon Valley culture where ‘Speed’ is the end all be all. Slowing down almost seems blasphemous. Time and time again you see VCs and founders placing speed as one of the most important traits for success. While I respect and completely agree with that opinion, I think it only reveals one part of the picture. “Slowness” is like salt - required in tiny amounts but essential. It allows your mind to wander, look at the big picture and realize contrarian truths.
            <br><br>
            While meditation might seem like the obvious route to slow down your mind and make it calmer, there is another thing one can do to (or not do!) cultivate “slowness” - Do nothing and don’t judge fast. Not focusing on your breath. Not focusing on how your body feels. Not having a goal of having no thoughts in your mind. Instead, let the mind do what it does best - Monkey around and swing from one branch to the next. You will find that “insights” (or fruits in this case) will pop up from nowhere. It’s exactly like that feeling in the shower when you have your best ideas.
            <br><br>
            Do nothing (Slow) → get insights → test insights by doing (Fast) → analyze results (Fast) → Do nothing (Slow)  
            <br><br>
            <i>Note: The “Do nothing” part only makes sense if you have decent operating speed and should be implemented in microdoses. Speed is still very important.</i>
