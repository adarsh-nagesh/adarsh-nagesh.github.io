        <h1>Frameworks and Boxes</h1>
        <p>The way we think and process information is very deeply frameworked - this is the ultimate limiter to creativity. We literally have a saying to describe this - "Think outside the box". 

           
            Our brain is filled with boxes. But what makes a box "a box"? The cardboard walls, arranged in a specific way, are what makes a box, a box. In our case, the language that describes a concept and our primal feelings are part of the constraint i.e. building material. Anything you build using those materials is directly or indirectly frameworked. 
            
            
            So independent thinking and truth-seeking require you to go beyond language and your primal feelings which are both deeply frameworked. Language is quite literally a framework and your primal feelings are a direct result of evolution - which is, at its core, a framework to optimize for genes that spread the fastest. 
            
           
            Seen another way - putting a deep concept into words always waters down the concept. Good writing reduces the loss in meaning but there is always a loss. Now when the writing is given to another, you introduce a whole new set of variables which further waters down the concept. Once again, good writing reduces this loss, but there is a loss nonetheless. 
            
            
            But half-truths don't exist. And your thinking cannot be "partially independent". It's either the truth or it is not. It is either independent or it is not. So you can't afford any loss. 
            
            
            So trying to scale your truth to others is useless. And consuming truth scaled by other people is equally useless. Exceptions exist, but they are extremely rare. 
            
            
            So if everything I have written makes complete sense to you:
            
            - I am an average writer and you are wrong but you think you understand because you are used to consuming frameworks and not noticing the watered-down quality
            
            - I am an exceptional writer and you are right (unlikely)
            
            
            There is no third or fourth option i.e. I am an average writer and you are right or I am an exceptional writer and you are wrong. 
            
            
            Nullius in Verba. </p>
